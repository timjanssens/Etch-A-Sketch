<h1>Etch-a-Sketch</h1>  
This is the source code for the Etch-a-Sketh project, part of The Odin Project's Web Development 101 course. The aim is to successfully use JavaScript to create the grid within a box of a fixed size, and then use DOM manipulation techniques to carry out the Etch-a-Sketch style functionality.
